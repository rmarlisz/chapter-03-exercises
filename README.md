# Chapter 3 Exercises

This repository contains programming exercises for using git and GitHub,
based on Chapter 3 of [_Programming Skills for Data Science_](https://programming-for-data-science.github.io/).

Solutions can be found in the `solution` branch.

This is my copy of the exercises, so I
can do what I want and test it out to
see what happens.
