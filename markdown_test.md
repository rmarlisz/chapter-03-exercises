# Try learning markdown

_Italics_ is first

Let's try **bold text** second

Here is a sample code block:
`Weird code font`

For a multi-line code block, use more of those back ticks:

```
Multi-line block of text
All the same font
```

## further stuff

>for a four-line or more quote,
you are supposed to use block quotes.
I'm not sure how to stop the block quote.
Hopefully it stops after this line

More text that should be normal.
-Bullet 1
-Bullet 2
-Third Bullet
